# üìª MORSE DECODER üìª
***Created by Luca Rios for a solo final project in Embedded in Embedded's (EiE's) mentorship program***
## What is this project‚ÅâÔ∏è
Morse code learning game developed for an embedded system ARM Cortex-M3 dev-board.

Coded entirely in an IAR IDE ***(requires subscription to compile so this project is inoperable without it unfortuatly)***

Primary language: C

Made use of state machine programming with various output modules
- LED (Visual feedback and morse code flashing)
- LCD (ASCII user display)
- Buzzers (Morse code audio feedback)
- Serialized output (Communication between logic board and LCD)
